# Personal Blog Back-Up Script

This is my personal blog back-up script. It performs the following tasks:

1. Checks for new blog posts every day.
2. If new posts are found, it creates a commit with the changes.
3. Pushes the changes to this repository.

## How to Run

1. Install dependencies:

```
npm install 
```

2. Run the script: 

``` 
node index.js
```
